= UML Shim PoC

== Overview

This code is for testing the use of a golang wrapper around UserMode Linux
for making stdin, stdout and stderr available to attach, detach
and reattach to from the host using Unix sockets.

Multiple sessions should be able to attach at once and share a synced
pty session.

== Usage

NOTE: for testing, the running process is bash as UserMode Linux
takes a while to boot.

To run the server:

[source,sh]
----
go run shim/shim.go
----

To connect to the session:

[source,sh]
----
go run client/client.go
----

== Problems

When multiple clients are connected, output often goes to only one client.

== Todo

* fix multi client problems
* work out detach sequences
* add process monitor to get exit code if process exits
To test this
