== `uml-runner` Container Image

The UML driver uses a Podman rootless container to allow
easy attaching / detaching from the tty,
to allow fully rootless networking and for easier machine management.

This is built using
link:https://github.com/b177y/koble-fs[koble-fs]
and is published at `docker.io/b177y/uml-runner`.

It is an ubuntu container image with the tools needed for running
and managing UML instances.
The entrypoint script sets up interfaces / mount points,
then runs the UML kernel command.

== Kernel and Filesystem

The UML filesystem is built using
link:https://github.com/b177y/koble-fs[koble-fs].
It is based on the same filesystem as that used for the Podman
driver but contains additions needed for UML,
and is formatted as an ext4 image.

The kernel is built using
link:https://github.com/b177y/koble-kernel[koble-kernel].
For docs on building and modifying the kernel for Koble see the
xref:uml-kernel:ROOT:index.adoc[docs].
