== Creating a Lab

To turn the current directory into a Koble lab:

[source,sh]
----
koble lab init
----

or to create a new directory for the lab:

[source,sh]
----
koble lab init --name newlab
----

To see more options, check out the xref:MAN:koble_lab_init.adoc[manpage].

=== lab.yml

The lab config is stored in `lab.yml`,
in the root of the lab directory.

An example config could be:

.lab.yml
[source,yaml]
----
authors:
- John Doe
created_at: 15-12-2021
driver:
  name: uml
koble_version: 0.0.1
machines:
  a:
    networks:
    - ar
----

* *created_at* - date in the format DD-MM-YYYY
* *koble_version* - version of Koble that the lab was created with
* *description* - a short description of the lab
* *authors* - a list of lab authors
* *emails* - a list of lab authors' email addresses
* *web* - a list of URIs associated with the lab (e.g. git repo /
documentation page)
* *machines* - a _map_ of lab machines.
All machines in the lab must be declared in _lab.yml_.
* *networks* - a _map_ of lab networks.
If a network is attached to a machine but does not have an entry
in *networks* it will be a simple network with no external access,
no set subnet / gateway etc.

.lab.yml example machine
[source,yaml]
----
machines:
  m1:
    networks:
    - ext
    hosthome: false
    hostlab: true
    depends_on:
    - m2
----

* *networks* - a list of network names to join machine to.
* *hosthome* - whether to mount $HOME on the host to /hosthome in the
virtual machine.
* *hostlab* - whether to mount the lab directory on the host to /hostlab
in the virtual machine.
If this is false then startup scripts and machine directories won't be
available inside the VM.
* *depends_on* - machines that need to finish booting before this machine
starts.

.lab.yml example network
[source,yaml]
----
networks:
  ext:
    external: true
    gateway: 10.16.55.254
    subnet: 10.16.55.0/24
----

* *external* - whether this machine should have external network access.
If the host machine has internet access then setting external to true will
give the VM internet access.
* *gateway* - the gateway address to use for the network
* *subnet* the subnet to use for the network

=== Adding Machines

To add a machine to a lab:

[source,sh]
----
koble machine add newmachine --network firstnet --network another
----

This will add an entry to the machines in `lab.yml`,
create a folder for the machine contents and
create a machine startup file.

=== Adding Networks

To add a network to a lab:

[source,sh]
----
koble net add firstnet
----

== Lab Commands

You can perform some of the commands that can be used for single machines against
a whole lab.
These include:

* start
* stop
* remove
* destroy

For example in a lab with machines *a* and *b*:

[source,sh]
----
koble lab stop
----

Is equivalent to doing

[source,sh]
----
koble stop a
koble stop b
----

== Advanced Configuration

.lab.yml
[source,yaml]
----
driver:
  name: uml
----

Additional configuration in *lab.yml* can be used to override global
Koble settings.
For example we can use the `driver` option to override the driver used for
the lab.

CAUTION: You should only run trusted labs where you have read the code
and configuration.
Arbitrary code can be run using some of the overrides,
such as a lab adding an additional terminal with a reverse shell in the command ðŸ˜Ž
